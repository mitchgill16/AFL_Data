Install conda packages within the requirements.txt
  - sorry this might be more than necessary to run this project, however
  this is the environment that works and a lot of packages have been picked up during
  the experimentation process

Make sure you also have R installed along with tidyverse & fitzRoy(https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy)

#to do
- retrain models on the most up to date data from 2021 onwards only though
- can we predict round 1
